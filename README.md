## API configs

The config is now located in env.ts file in the root folder of the project. It's not under git, so you need to copy it from _env.ts 

`cp _env.ts env.ts`
 
 first time before building the project. If you need change the main API URL.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.
